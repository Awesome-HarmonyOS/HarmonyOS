 * agreement is required, if any callback returns an error code, further notifications
 * before switch notifications are cancelled and all already notified callbacks are re-invoked.
 * The index of the callback which returned error code during pre-switch notifications is stored
 * (any error codes during callbacks re-invocation are ignored) and NOTIFIER_GetErrorCallback() can be used to get it.
