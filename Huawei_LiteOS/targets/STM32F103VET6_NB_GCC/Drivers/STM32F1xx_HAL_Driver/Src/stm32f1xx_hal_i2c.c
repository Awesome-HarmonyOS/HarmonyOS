  ==============================================================================
                        ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
  [..]
    The I2C HAL driver can be used as follows:

    (#) Declare a I2C_HandleTypeDef handle structure, for example:
        I2C_HandleTypeDef  hi2c;

    (#)Initialize the I2C low level resources by implementing the HAL_I2C_MspInit() API:
        (##) Enable the I2Cx interface clock
        (##) I2C pins configuration
            (+++) Enable the clock for the I2C GPIOs
            (+++) Configure I2C pins as alternate function open-drain
        (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process
            (+++) Configure the I2Cx interrupt priority
            (+++) Enable the NVIC I2C IRQ Channel
        (##) DMA Configuration if you need to use DMA process
            (+++) Declare a DMA_HandleTypeDef handle structure for the transmit or receive channel
            (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using
            (+++) Configure the DMA handle parameters
            (+++) Configure the DMA Tx or Rx channel
            (+++) Associate the initialized DMA handle to the hi2c DMA Tx or Rx handle
            (+++) Configure the priority and enable the NVIC for the transfer complete interrupt on 
                  the DMA Tx or Rx channel

    (#) Configure the Communication Speed, Duty cycle, Addressing mode, Own Address1,
        Dual Addressing mode, Own Address2, General call and Nostretch mode in the hi2c Init structure.

    (#) Initialize the I2C registers by calling the HAL_I2C_Init(), configures also the low level Hardware 
        (GPIO, CLOCK, NVIC...etc) by calling the customized HAL_I2C_MspInit(&hi2c) API.

    (#) To check if target device is ready for communication, use the function HAL_I2C_IsDeviceReady()

       (@) You can refer to the I2C HAL driver header file for more useful macros

     *** I2C Workarounds linked to Silicon Limitation ***
     ====================================================
     [..]
       Below the list of all silicon limitations implemented for HAL on STM32F1xx product.
       (@) See ErrataSheet to know full silicon limitation list of your product.

       (#) Workarounds Implemented inside I2C HAL Driver
          (##) Wrong data read into data register (Polling and Interrupt mode)
          (##) Start cannot be generated after a misplaced Stop
          (##) Some software events must be managed before the current byte is being transferred: 
               Workaround: Use DMA in general, except when the Master is receiving a single byte.
               For Interupt mode, I2C should have the highest priority in the application.
          (##) Mismatch on the "Setup time for a repeated Start condition" timing parameter:
               Workaround: Reduce the frequency down to 88 kHz or use the I2C Fast-mode if 
               supported by the slave.
          (##) Data valid time (tVD;DAT) violated without the OVR flag being set:
               Workaround: If the slave device allows it, use the clock stretching mechanism 
               by programming NoStretchMode = I2C_NOSTRETCH_DISABLE in HAL_I2C_Init.

    [..]
    This subsection provides a set of functions allowing to manage the I2C data
    transfers.

    (#) There are two modes of transfer:
       (++) Blocking mode : The communication is performed in the polling mode.
            The status of all data processing is returned by the same function
            after finishing transfer.
       (++) No-Blocking mode : The communication is performed using Interrupts
            or DMA. These functions return the status of the transfer startup.
            The end of the data processing will be indicated through the
            dedicated I2C IRQ when using Interrupt mode or the DMA IRQ when
            using DMA mode.

    (#) Blocking mode functions are :
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Receive()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Write()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Read()
        (++) HAL_I2C_IsDeviceReady()

    (#) No-Blocking mode functions with Interrupt are :
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Receive_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Sequential_Transmit_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Sequential_Receive_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Sequential_Transmit_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Sequential_Receive_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_IT()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_IT()

    (#) No-Blocking mode functions with DMA are :
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Transmit_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Master_Receive_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Transmit_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Slave_Receive_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_DMA()
        (++) HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_DMA()

    (#) A set of Transfer Complete Callbacks are provided in non Blocking mode:
        (++) HAL_I2C_MemTxCpltCallback()
        (++) HAL_I2C_MemRxCpltCallback()
        (++) HAL_I2C_MasterTxCpltCallback()
        (++) HAL_I2C_MasterRxCpltCallback()
        (++) HAL_I2C_SlaveTxCpltCallback()
        (++) HAL_I2C_SlaveRxCpltCallback()
        (++) HAL_I2C_ErrorCallback()
        (++) HAL_I2C_AbortCpltCallback()
