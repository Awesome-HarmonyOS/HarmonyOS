                                   Note: In dual mode, a change of channel configuration generates a restart that can produce a loss of synchronization. It is recommended to disable dual mode before any configuration change.
                                   Note: In case of simultaneous mode used: Exactly the same sampling time should be configured for the 2 channels that will be sampled simultaneously by ACD1 and ADC2.
                                   Note: In case of interleaved mode used: To avoid overlap between conversions, maximum sampling time allowed is 7 ADC clock cycles for fast interleaved mode and 14 ADC clock cycles for slow interleaved mode.
                                   Note: Some multimode parameters are fixed on STM32F1 and can be configured on other STM32 devices with several ADC (multimode configuration structure can have additional parameters).
                                         The equivalences are:
                                           - Parameter 'DMAAccessMode': On STM32F1, this parameter is fixed to 1 DMA channel (one DMA channel for both ADC, DMA of ADC master). On other STM32 devices with several ADC, this is equivalent to parameter 'ADC_DMAACCESSMODE_12_10_BITS'.
                                           - Parameter 'TwoSamplingDelay': On STM32F1, this parameter is fixed to 7 or 14 ADC clock cycles depending on fast or slow interleaved mode selected. On other STM32 devices with several ADC, this is equivalent to parameter 'ADC_TWOSAMPLINGDELAY_7CYCLES' (for fast interleaved mode). */
